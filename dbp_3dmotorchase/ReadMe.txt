3D Motor Chase for Dark Basic Pro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This game took less than 36 hours to complete. Okay, fair enough, I had
already written a version in Dark GDK C/C++. Besides the point, there
are people out there that are still writing a game that's taking
anything upto 3 years and still not finished. The original Dark GDK
version of this game took me only 16 days to complete. Okay, fair
enough again, I haven't fancied either up at all.

For those who are checking out the source code to this game then
you will need to install the PNoise plugin.

Copy the PNoise.dll in to the plugins-user\ directory
Copy the PNoise.ini in to the editor\keywords directory

The release of this source code is intended for educational purposes
for those who are willing to study and learn Dark Basic Pro programming.
